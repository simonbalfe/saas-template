We've all received them. The "personalized" email that starts with:
*"Hi [Name], I see you work at [Company]. I'd love to chat about synergies..."*

It's lazy, it's obvious, and it gets deleted immediately.

Real personalization proves you've done your homework. It builds trust before you even ask for a meeting. But doing deep research for every prospect is impossible at scale... or is it?

## The 10-80-10 Rule of Email Copy

The best cold emails follow a simple structure:
*   **10%:** Highly personalized hook (shows you know them).
*   **80%:** Relevant value proposition (your core offer).
*   **10%:** Soft call to action (interest-based).

The challenge has always been that first 10%.

## Automating the Hook with AI

You can now use AI workflows to generate unique openers based on live data.

### Example: The "Recent News" Hook
**Workflow:**
1.  Scrape the "News" or "Press" section of the company website.
2.  Identify a recent product launch or partnership.
3.  Generate a sentence connecting that news to your offer.

**Output:**
> *"Saw you just launched the new mobile app—congrats on expanding to iOS. That shift usually comes with new support challenges, which is why I'm reaching out..."*

### Example: The "Hiring" Hook
**Workflow:**
1.  Check their careers page.
2.  Identify open roles in relevant departments.
3.  Frame your solution as a way to help that growing team.

**Output:**
> *"Noticed you're aggressively hiring for SDRs right now. Onboarding that many new reps is tough, so I wanted to share how we help teams ramp faster..."*

## Don't Fake It

The key to AI personalization is **relevance**, not flattery. Don't compliment their website design if it's ugly. Don't congratulate them on a generic award.

Use Lead Spice to extract *meaningful* signals—technology changes, strategic shifts, hiring patterns—and use those as the foundation for a conversation.

## Scale Without Spam

This isn't about spamming more people. It's about reaching the *right* people with a message that actually matters to them. When you combine clean data, smart qualification, and deep personalization, you don't need to send 1,000 emails to get a meeting. You might only need 50.
