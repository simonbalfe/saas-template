"Quantity over quality" is a relic of the old sales playbook. In 2024, the most successful teams are obsessed with **relevance**. But filtering a list of 10,000 leads to find the 500 perfect fits has always been a manual, subjective nightmare.

Enter AI-powered lead qualification.

## The Problem with Keyword Filtering

Most sales tools rely on simple boolean logic. You filter for "Software" industry and "11-50" employees.

The problem? You miss the nuance.
*   A "Software" company could be a dev shop or a SaaS product.
*   A company with 50 employees on LinkedIn might actually have 200 globally.

## How LLMs Qualify Leads Like a Human

Large Language Models (LLMs) can read a company's website and understand *context* just like a human researcher would.

Instead of filtering by "Industry = SaaS", you can ask an AI agent:
> *"Is this company a B2B SaaS platform that sells primarily to HR departments? Score from 0-10 and explain why."*

### The Lead Spice Approach

With Lead Spice, you can build custom qualification workflows that go deep:

1.  **Web Scraping:** The AI visits the prospect's homepage to gather current messaging.
2.  **Semantic Analysis:** It analyzes their value proposition against your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP).
3.  **Scoring & Reasoning:** It assigns a fit score and provides a one-sentence reason *why* they are a good or bad fit.

## Case Study: Finding "PLG" Companies

One of our users wanted to target Product-Led Growth (PLG) companies. There is no "PLG" industry filter in LinkedIn Sales Navigator.

By using an AI workflow, they processed 5,000 SaaS companies. The AI looked for specific signals on their websites: "Start for free" buttons, transparent pricing pages, and self-serve documentation.

**The Result:** They identified 340 highly qualified accounts that their competitors were missing because they weren't categorized correctly in traditional databases.

## Focus on Your Best Buyers

When your sales team wakes up to a list of leads that have already been vetted and scored, they stop being data entry clerks and start being closers.
